# Day 6 - JDBC

## Exam Topics

Exam topics include:
* JDBC API interfaces - Driver, Connection, Statement, and ResultSet (and their relationship to provider implementations)
* Identify the components required to connect to a database using the DriverManager class including the JDBC URL
* Submit queries and read results from the database

The last topic includes:
* creating statements,
* returning result sets,
* iterating through the results, and
* properly closing result sets, statements, and connections

The following are in the scope according to Java Tutorial:
* transactions
* RowSet and JdbcRowSet objects

The following are out of the scope:
* what is the Relational Database,
* RDBMS vendors and products
* DataSource interface
* advanced data type such as XML
* stored procedures

## Environment

Some guides should be available:
* installing one of RDBMS products,
* installing the JDBC driver for the product,
* creating a sample database and populating tables

## Gold Exam Book

* 18 - C, JDBC 3.0 drivers were loaded by Class.forName() GOOD
* 28 - D, Connection is auto-closed GOOD
* 40 - A, DriverManager return Connection objects NO-GOOD
* 58 - NO-GOOD
* 77 - C, Connection.createStatement() never accept SQL string GOOD
* 80 - ?, ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE, updateString(), absolute() NO-GOOD, for poor SQLite3

## JDBC APIs Covered in the Lecture

Topics relating to JDBC API includes:
* establishing connections (DriverManager, JDBC driver URL, Connection)
* creating statements (Statement, PreparedStatement)
* returning result sets (executeQuery, executeUpdate)
* iterating through the results (getInt, getString, handling NULL)
* handling exceptions (SQLException)
* properly closing connections (try-with-resources)
* transactions (setAutoCommit, commit, rollback)
* handling exception from rollback (try-catch-finally nested in try-with-resources)

Following topics are not covered:
* DataSource interface
* RowSet and JdbcRowSet objects
* advanced data type such as XML
* stored procedures
